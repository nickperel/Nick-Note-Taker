  ## Description
  
  * This week I was given started code that took care of the front end development and was tasked with creating the back end and tying it together with the front end in order to make the application function as desired. On page load, the user should be directed to a landing page where there will be a button that links the user to the actual notes page. When the button is clicked, a new page loads that dispalys all existing notes in the left hand column of the page, while the right hand column displays a place where a new note title and note text can be filled in by the user. Once the user fills in the note title and text areas, a save button will appear in the top right corner of the page that will allow the user to save their new note. Once the save button is clicked, this new note should appear underneath the existing notes in the left side column. Users can also add a new note by clicking the '+' button in the top right corner of the page. When a user clicks on an existing note, the details of that note should then fill in the right side column of the page so that it can be read. Users also have the ability to delete any notes that they desire by clicking the red trash can on the right side of the existing notes list, which each individual note will have next to it.
